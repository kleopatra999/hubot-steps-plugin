== Build

Run `mvn package` to build a deployable hpi bundle for Jenkins. Note this plugin **REQUIRES JDK 1.8** to build.

== Steps & Configuration

The following Jenkins pipeline steps are available if you add this plugin to your Jenkins.

=== **hubotSend**

Allows sending of a message to the hubot chat bot

[source,groovy]
----
hubotSend room: 'release', message: 'Releasing this project.', url: 'http://localhost:9999', failOnError: true
----

* `url` is optional, if it is provided as global environment variable `HUBOT_URL` or provided by `withEnv` step, this should always end with `/`, environment variable takes the lower precedence.

* `room` is optional, if it is provided as global environment variable `HUBOT_DEFAULT_ROOM` or provided by `withEnv` step, and room doesn't require `#`, it is added in the code, environment variable takes the lower precedence.

* `message` is required, actual message to be sent. Which is being prefixed with Job: #BUILD_URL string.

* `failOnError` is optional and by default it is `true`, if any error it won't abort the job., it can also be provided as global environment variable `HUBOT_FAIL_ON_ERROR`, environment variable takes the higher precedence.

=== **hubotApprove**

Sends a hubot message the project chat room for a project when the build is waiting for user input with the hubot commands to proceed or abort the build.

[source,groovy]
----
hubotApprove room: 'release', message: 'Proceed with building this Job?', url: 'http://localhost:9999/', failOnError: true
----

* `url` is optional, if it is provided as global environment variable `HUBOT_URL` or provided by `withEnv` step, this should always end with `/`, environment variable takes the lower precedence.

* `message` is required, actual message to be sent. Which is being prefixed with Job: #BUILD_URL string.

* `room` is optional, if it is provided as global environment variable `HUBOT_DEFAULT_ROOM` or provided by `withEnv` step, and room doesn't require `#`, it is added in the code, environment variable takes the lower precedence.

* `failOnError` is optional and by default it is `true`, if any error it won't abort the job., it can also be provided as global variable `HUBOT_FAIL_ON_ERROR`, environment variable takes the higher precedence.

* Example

== Hubot Setup

=== New to hubot?

Refer to https://github.com/ThoughtsLive/hubot-base[hubot-base] to setup a either docker container or to run it locally.

[Note]
====
Please replace scripts on hubot-base repo with the scripts under this hubot-steps repo and it is always a good idea to copy over the scripts from appropriate tag based on the version being installed on Jenkins.
====

=== Already running hubot.

Then just copy over following scripts from `scripts` folder.

* https://github.com/jenkinsci/hubot-steps/blob/master/scripts/hubot.coffee[hubot]
